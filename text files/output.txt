**Basic Facts**:
Pilea peperomioides, also known as the Chinese money plant, UFO plant, pancake plant, lefse plant, or missionary plant, is a flowering plant native to Yunnan and Sichuan provinces in southern China. It has gained popularity as a houseplant due to its ease of growth and ability to thrive in dry environments.

**Placement in the House**:
Pilea peperomioides can be placed in a variety of indoor locations, including unheated areas or outdoors in temperate climates. However, it is generally considered a houseplant and thrives in indoor environments with bright, indirect light.

**Temperature, Sunlight, and Water Requirements**:
- Temperature: Prefers temperatures between 13–30°C (55–86°F), but can tolerate temperatures as low as −9°C (16°F) with some protection.
- Sunlight: Needs bright, indirect light.
- Water: Requires moderate watering, tolerating dry environments but benefiting from high humidity. Water when the top layer of soil dries out.

**Additional Care Requirements**:
Pilea peperomioides benefits from propagation through plantlets that sprout on the trunk of the parent plant or underground shoots (rhizomes). It also requires a well-draining potting mix and can be grown in terrariums. Regular fertilization can promote healthy growth. Pruning is not necessary, but removing dead or damaged leaves can help maintain the plant's appearance.

**Lifespan and Difficulty of Care**:
Pilea peperomioides is considered a low-maintenance plant, easy to care for and relatively pest- and disease-free. With proper care, it can live for several years, and its ability to regrow from underground shoots makes it a hardy and resilient plant. It is suitable for both beginners and experienced gardeners, and its popularity as a houseplant is due in part to its ease of cultivation and maintenance.
